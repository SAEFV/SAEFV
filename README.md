## What I Do (or break)

- Linux enjoyer (Ubuntu Server is home)
- DevOps tinkerer â€” Puppet, system configs, light scripting
- Infra curious â€” networks, VMs, servers... if it runs, Iâ€™ll poke it
- Learning by doing (and breaking)
- Automate first, understand later

---

## Current Interests

- Puppet setup experiments
- Home lab vibes
- Lightweight self-hosting
- Markdown documentation for everything

---

## Projects & Logs

Youâ€™ll find messy notes, random automation, and maybe a working setup or two.  
No guarantees. Just vibes and curiosity.

---

## Philosophy

I document things so I don't forget.  
I test things so others donâ€™t have to.  
I learn because I can.  
I break things because they stop making sense until I do.
