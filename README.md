## 🛠️ What I Do (or break)

- 🐧 Linux enjoyer (Ubuntu Server is home)
- 🔧 DevOps tinkerer — Puppet, system configs, light scripting
- 🧠 Infra curious — networks, VMs, servers... if it runs, I’ll poke it
- 🧪 Learning by doing (and breaking)
- 🤖 Automate first, understand later

---

## 🔍 Current Interests

- Puppet setup experiments
- Home lab vibes
- Lightweight self-hosting
- Markdown documentation for everything

---

## 📁 Projects & Logs

You’ll find messy notes, random automation, and maybe a working setup or two.  
No guarantees. Just vibes and curiosity.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

I document things so I don't forget.  
I test things so others don’t have to.  
I learn because I can.  
I break things because they stop making sense until I do.
