## What I Do (or break)

- Linux enjoyer (Ubuntu Server is home)
- Infra — networks, VMs, servers
- Learning by doing (and breaking)
- Automate first, understand later

---

## Current Interests

- canonical solutions
- Home lab vibes
- Lightweight self-hosting
- Markdown documentation for everything, if i document ¬_¬

---

## Philosophy
 
I test things so others don’t have to.  
I learn because I can.  
I break things because they stop making sense until I do.
